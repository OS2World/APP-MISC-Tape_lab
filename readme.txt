	This archive contains an Audio Tape Label Editor which uses
the PM++ class library by G.Iachello, version 0.16 or above.
See the documentation of that package for it's installation.
	To build the program you'll need:
	
	emx 0.9a patchlevel 3 or above
	dmake
	
	To build the program, edit the makefile and set the CFLAGS and OS2CLASS
variables to point to the directory where the PM++ include and library files
are. (If you did'nt install the emx compiler in the /emx directory, you'll
have to edit also the other directory definitions at the beginning of the 
makefile). Then type:

	dmake
